# Predastore Benchmark Harness

A minimal, manually-invoked harness for tracking predastore performance over time. The goal is regression tracking across commits, not marketing numbers or micro-optimisation.

## Contents

- `bench-disk.sh` — raw-disk fio ceiling (run independently of predastore).
- `bench-cluster.sh` — predastore cluster on loopback, driven by `warp mixed`.
- `fio-jobs/` — four fio jobs covering predastore's predicted access patterns.

All benchmarks can be run via the top-level dispatcher:

    ./scripts/bench.sh disk          # raw-disk fio
    ./scripts/bench.sh 3node         # cluster warp benchmark

## Prerequisites

- `fio` (`apt install fio`).
- `warp` (`go install github.com/minio/warp@latest`).
- `curl`, `ip` (usually present on Linux).
- `make build` in the predastore repo (produces `bin/s3d`).
- `make certs` to generate TLS certificates (or `make build`, which does both).
- `sudo` — required only by `bench-cluster.sh` for `ip addr add` on `lo`. The script aliases `10.11.12.{1,2,3}/24` and removes them on exit.

## Usage

### PUT/multipart/GET end-to-end performance

The benchmark used for front-door storage changes is self-contained and works
in colocated mode on macOS and Linux:

    make e2e-performance

The Makefile installs the pinned Warp release under `bin/tools` when missing,
builds Predastore, starts RS(1,0) and RS(3,1) topologies one at a time, and
runs two layers of validation:

1. AWS CLI single PUT and forced multipart upload followed by GET, `diff -q`,
   and SHA-256 comparison of the local source/download files.
2. Isolated Warp `put`, `multipart-put`, `multipart`, and `get` workloads.

The default `PERF_PRESET=smoke` is intentionally laptop-sized. Record a stable
comparison run with:

    make e2e-performance PERF_PRESET=compare

Results are written below `scripts/bench/results/e2e-performance/` and include
the exact config, commit/dirty state, tool versions, correctness hashes, server
logs, Warp logs, and Warp `.json.zst` data. Warp uses unique disposable buckets
with `--noclear` because Predastore does not implement Warp's batch cleanup
route; the entire per-run Predastore data directory is removed afterward.

Compare matching artifacts from two runs with:

    make e2e-performance-compare \
        PERF_BEFORE=scripts/bench/results/e2e-performance/<before> \
        PERF_AFTER=scripts/bench/results/e2e-performance/<after>

Useful overrides include `PERF_CONFIGS=4node`, `PERF_DURATION=30s`,
`PERF_CONCURRENT=4`, `PERF_PUT_SIZE=16MiB`, `PERF_PART_SIZE=8MiB`, and
`PERF_PARTS=8`. Set `PERF_KEEP_WORK=1` to retain the disposable cluster data
for diagnosis.

Raw disk ceiling:

    ./scripts/bench/bench-disk.sh

fio writes to `$PREDA_DIR/disk` (parallel to predastore's `distributed/` tree); each job runs twice (buffered and `--direct=1`) and produces a JSON file per run under `scripts/bench/results/disk-<timestamp>/`.

Predastore cluster benchmark:

    ./scripts/bench.sh 3node
    # or directly:
    ./scripts/bench/bench-cluster.sh 3node

Results land under `predastore/scripts/bench/results/<clustername>-<timestamp>/` and contain:

- `warp-mixed.csv.zst` — warp's raw samples.
- `cluster.toml` — the config used for the run.
- `run-info.txt` — commit SHA, warp version, date, hostname.

### `PREDA_DIR`

All scripts share a single root directory controlled by `PREDA_DIR` (default `/tmp/predastore`). Cluster data, warp temp files (`.warp-tmp/`), and fio targets all live under this path. Override it to move everything off tmpfs:

    PREDA_DIR=/var/lib/predastore ./scripts/bench.sh 3node

With RS(2,1) the on-disk footprint is ~1.5× the logical object volume, spread across three nodes; warp's defaults (2500 × 10 MiB) do not fit a typical dev-host tmpfs.

### Tuning warp mixed

Four env vars forward through to `warp mixed`; leaving any of them unset keeps warp's own default:

| Variable          | warp flag      | warp default |
|-------------------|----------------|--------------|
| `WARP_OBJECTS`    | `--objects`    | 2500         |
| `WARP_OBJ_SIZE`   | `--obj.size`   | 10MiB        |
| `WARP_DURATION`   | `--duration`   | 5m           |
| `WARP_CONCURRENT` | `--concurrent` | 20           |

For a tmpfs-safe local run (~750 MB on disk):

    WARP_OBJECTS=512 WARP_OBJ_SIZE=1MiB WARP_DURATION=30s WARP_CONCURRENT=10 \
        ./scripts/bench/bench-cluster.sh

Dedicated-hardware CI runs leave them unset.

## fio Jobs

Each job maps to an access pattern predastore is predicted to exhibit in production. Every job runs twice — buffered and `--direct=1` — so cache effects are visible.

| Job               | Pattern               | Reflects                                      |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `seq-write-1m`    | `write`, 1M, fsync-on-close | Bulk ingest ceiling (PutObject, AMI writes)   |
| `rand-write-8k`   | `randwrite`, 8k, `fsync=1`, iodepth 32 | WAL `WriteAt` pattern |
| `seq-read-1m`     | `read`, 1M            | Bulk GET ceiling                              |
| `rand-read-8k`    | `randread`, 8k, iodepth 32 | RS reconstruction read fan-out           |

## Predastore Config

Uses `clusters/3node/cluster.toml` directly (static config, no templating):

- **RS(2, 1)** — 2 data shards + 1 parity.
- **3 db nodes** on `10.11.12.{1,2,3}:6660` — Raft quorum for metadata, node 1 is the bootstrap leader.
- **3 QUIC storage nodes** on `10.11.12.{1,2,3}:9991` — shard distribution across the three processes.
- **No buckets configured** — warp creates its own via `--bucket=predastore`.
- **Test credentials** — `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE` / standard test secret key. Self-contained; no AWS profile or credential files needed.
- **`-base-path $PREDA_DIR/<cluster>` passed on the CLI** — the distributed backend resolves relative data paths from the cluster config against this root.

## Deferred

Out of scope for this pass, kept as follow-on work:

- MinIO comparison numbers.
- Tuned warp workloads (duration, object size, concurrency).
- CI-gated regression detection and `benchstat`-level statistical rigour.
- Separated client/server hosts.
- Automated trend visualisation.

The absolute throughput numbers from a single-host run will be lower than a separated-client or real-multi-host setup; the same setup run on a later commit gives a comparable delta, which is what this harness is for.
